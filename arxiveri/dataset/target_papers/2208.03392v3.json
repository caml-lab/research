{"title": "Federated Learning for Medical Applications: A Taxonomy, Current Trends, Challenges, and Future Research Directions", "abstract": "With the advent of the IoT, AI, and ML/DL algorithms, the data-driven medical\napplication has emerged as a promising tool for designing reliable and scalable\ndiagnostic and prognostic models from medical data. This has attracted a great\ndeal of attention from academia to industry in recent years. This has\nundoubtedly improved the quality of healthcare delivery. However, these\nAI-based medical applications still have poor adoption due to their\ndifficulties in satisfying strict security, privacy, and quality of service\nstandards (such as low latency). Moreover, medical data are usually fragmented\nand private, making it challenging to generate robust results across\npopulations. Recent developments in federated learning (FL) have made it\npossible to train complex machine-learned models in a distributed manner. Thus,\nFL has become an active research domain, particularly processing the medical\ndata at the edge of the network in a decentralized way to preserve privacy and\nsecurity concerns. To this end, this survey paper highlights the current and\nfuture of FL technology in medical applications where data sharing is a\nsignificant burden. It also review and discuss the current research trends and\ntheir outcomes for designing reliable and scalable FL models. We outline the\ngeneral FL's statistical problems, device challenges, security, privacy\nconcerns, and its potential in the medical domain. Moreover, our study is also\nfocused on medical applications where we highlight the burden of global cancer\nand the efficient use of FL for the development of computer-aided diagnosis\ntools for addressing them. We hope that this review serves as a checkpoint that\nsets forth the existing state-of-the-art works in a thorough manner and offers\nopen problems and future research directions for this field.", "authors": ["Ashish Rauniyar", "Desta Haileselassie Hagos", "Debesh Jha", "Jan Erik H\u00e5keg\u00e5rd", "Ulas Bagci", "Danda B.
