{"title": "Domain Camera Adaptation and Collaborative Multiple Feature Clustering for Unsupervised Person Re-ID", "abstract": "Recently unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) has drawn much\nattention due to its open-world scenario settings where limited annotated data\nis available. Existing supervised methods often fail to generalize well on\nunseen domains, while the unsupervised methods, mostly lack multi-granularity\ninformation and are prone to suffer from confirmation bias. In this paper, we\naim at finding better feature representations on the unseen target domain from\ntwo aspects, 1) performing unsupervised domain adaptation on the labeled source\ndomain and 2) mining potential similarities on the unlabeled target domain.\nBesides, a collaborative pseudo re-labeling strategy is proposed to alleviate\nthe influence of confirmation bias. Firstly, a generative adversarial network\nis utilized to transfer images from the source domain to the target domain.\nMoreover, person identity preserving and identity mapping losses are introduced\nto improve the quality of generated images. Secondly, we propose a novel\ncollaborative multiple feature clustering framework (CMFC) to learn the\ninternal data structure of target domain, including global feature and partial\nfeature branches. The global feature branch (GB) employs unsupervised\nclustering on the global feature of person images while the Partial feature\nbranch (PB) mines similarities within different body regions. Finally,\nextensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show the competitive\nperformance of our method under unsupervised person re-ID settings.", "authors": ["Yuanpeng Tu"], "published_date": "2022_08_18", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08624v1", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><tbody><tr><th rowspan=\"2\">Method</th><td colspan=\"4\">Duke \\rightarrow Market</td><td colspan=\"4\">Market \\rightarrow Duke</td></tr><tr><td>rank-1</td><td>rank-5</td><td>rank-10</td><td>mAP</td><td>rank-1</td><td>rank-5</td><td>rank-10</td><td>mAP</td></tr><tr><th>LOMO (Liaoet al., 2015)</th><td>27.2</td><td>41.6</td><td>49.1</td><td>8.0</td><td>12.3</td><td>21.3</td><td>26.6</td><td>4.8</td></tr><tr><th>Bow (Zhenget al., 2015)</th><td>35.8</td><td>52.4</td><td>60.3</td><td>14.8</td><td>17.1</td><td>28.8</td><td>34.9</td><td>8.3</td></tr><tr><th>PTGAN (Weiet al., 2018)</th><td>38.6</td><td>-</td><td>66.1</td><td>-</td><td>27.4</td><td>-</td><td>50.7</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><th>SPGAN (Isolaet al., 2017)</th><td>51.5</td><td>70.1</td><td>76.8</td><td>22.8</td><td>41.1</td><td>56.6</td><td>63.0</td><td>22.3</td></tr><tr><th>SPGAN+LMP (Isolaet al., 2017)</th><td>57.7</td><td>75.8</td><td>82.4</td><td>26.7</td><td>46.4</td><td>62.3</td><td>68.0</td><td>26.2</td></tr><tr><th>ARN (Liet al., 2018a)</th><td>70.3</td><td>80.4</td><td>86.3</td><td>39.4</td><td>60.2</td><td>73.9</td><td>79.5</td><td>33.4</td></tr><tr><th>UDAP (Song et al., 2020)</th><td>75.8</td><td>89.5</td><td>93.2</td><td>53.7</td><td>68.4</td><td>80.1</td><td>83.5</td><td>49.0</td></tr><tr><th>PUL (Fanet al., 2018)</th><td>45.5</td><td>60.7</td><td>66.7</td><td>20.5</td><td>30.0</td><td>43.4</td><td>48.5</td><td>16.4</td></tr><tr><th>HHL (Zhonget al., 2018)</th><td>62.2</td><td>78.8</td><td>84.0</td><td>31.4</td><td>46.9</td><td>61.0</td><td>66.7</td><td>27.2</td></tr><tr><th>MAR (Yuet al., 2019)</th><td>67.7</td><td>81.9</td><td>-</td><td>40.0</td><td>67.1</td><td>79.8</td><td>-</td><td>48.0</td></tr><tr><th>ECN (Zhonget al., 2019)</th><td>75.1</td><td>87.6</td><td>91.6</td><td>43.0</td><td>63.3</td><td>75.8</td><td>80.4</td><td>40.4</td></tr><tr><th>SSG (Fuet al., 2019)</th><td>80.0</td><td>90.0</td><td>92.4</td><td>58.3</td><td>73.0</td><td>80.6</td><td>83.2</td><td>53.4</td></tr><tr><th>MMT (Ge et al., 2020)</th><td>86.8</td><td>94.6</td><td>96.9</td><td>69.0</td><td>78.0</td><td>88.8</td><td>92.5</td><td>65.1</td></tr><tr><th>DCF (Liet al., 2021)</th><td>86.1</td><td>94.2</td><td>96.0</td><td>67.6</td><td>75.8</td><td>86.5</td><td>89.4</td><td>58.3</td></tr><tr><th>GLT (Zhenget al., 2021a)</th><td>92.2</td><td>96.5</td><td>97.8</td><td>79.5</td><td>82.0</td><td>90.2</td><td>92.8</td><td>69.2</td></tr><tr><th>UNRN (Zhenget al., 2021b)</th><td>91.9</td><td>96.1</td><td>97.8</td><td>78.1</td><td>82.0</td><td>90.7</td><td>93.5</td><td>69.1</td></tr><tr><th>CMFC(Ours)</th><td>94.0</td><td>97.1</td><td>98.3</td><td>81.0</td><td>83.2</td><td>91.6</td><td>94.0</td><td>71.2</td></tr></tbody></table>", "caption": "Table 2.
