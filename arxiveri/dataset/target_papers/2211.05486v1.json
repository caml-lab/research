{"title": "HSGNet: Object Re-identification with Hierarchical Similarity Graph Network", "abstract": "Object re-identification method is made up of backbone network, feature\naggregation, and loss function. However, most backbone networks lack a special\nmechanism to handle rich scale variations and mine discriminative feature\nrepresentations. In this paper, we firstly design a hierarchical similarity\ngraph module (HSGM) to reduce the conflict of backbone and re-identification\nnetworks. The designed HSGM builds a rich hierarchical graph to mine the\nmapping relationships between global-local and local-local. Secondly, we divide\nthe feature map along with the spatial and channel directions in each\nhierarchical graph. The HSGM applies the spatial features and channel features\nextracted from different locations as nodes, respectively, and utilizes the\nsimilarity scores between nodes to construct spatial and channel similarity\ngraphs. During the learning process of HSGM, we utilize a learnable parameter\nto re-optimize the importance of each position, as well as evaluate the\ncorrelation between different nodes. Thirdly, we develop a novel hierarchical\nsimilarity graph network (HSGNet) by embedding the HSGM in the backbone\nnetwork. Furthermore, HSGM can be easily embedded into backbone networks of any\ndepth to improve object re-identification ability. Finally, extensive\nexperiments on three large-scale object datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nHSGNet is superior to state-of-the-art object re-identification approaches.", "authors": ["Fei Shen", "Mengwan Wei", "Junchi Ren"], "published_date": "2022_11_10", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05486v1", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><tbody><tr><th>Methods</th><td>Rank1</td><td>Rank5</td><td>mAP</td></tr><tr><th>SpindleNet [8]</th><td>76.9</td><td>91.5</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><th>PAR [18]</th><td>81.0</td><td>92.0</td><td>63.4</td></tr><tr><th>LSRO [54]</th><td>84.0</td><td>-</td><td>66.1</td></tr><tr><th>MultiScale [55]</th><td>88.9</td><td>-</td><td>73.1</td></tr><tr><th>HA-CNN [56]</th><td>91.2</td><td>-</td><td>75.7</td></tr><tr><th>DuATM [29]</th><td>91.4</td><td>-</td><td>76.6</td></tr><tr><th>PGFA [57]</th><td>91.2</td><td>-</td><td>76.8</td></tr><tr><th>VPM [22]</th><td>93.0</td><td>-</td><td>80.8</td></tr><tr><th>PCB [20]</th><td>93.8</td><td>97.5</td><td>81.6</td></tr><tr><th>AANet [58]</th><td>93.8</td><td>-</td><td>82.4</td></tr><tr><th>HPM [21]</th><td>94.2</td><td>97.5</td><td>82.7</td></tr><tr><th>HOReID[59]</th><td>94.2</td><td>-</td><td>84.9</td></tr><tr><th>SNR [60]</th><td>94.4</td><td>-</td><td>84.7</td></tr><tr><th>IANet [48]</th><td>94.4</td><td>-</td><td>83.1</td></tr><tr><th>P{}^{2}-Net [61]</th><td>95.2</td><td>98.2</td><td>85.6</td></tr><tr><th>BoT (Baseline) [49]</th><td>93.8</td><td>97.3</td><td>84.5</td></tr><tr><th>HSGNet</th><td>95.0</td><td>98.9</td><td>86.6</td></tr></tbody></table>", "caption": "TABLE I: The performance comparison of the proposedmethod and state-of-the-art approaches on Market-1501 dataset.", "list_citation_info": ["[54] Z.
