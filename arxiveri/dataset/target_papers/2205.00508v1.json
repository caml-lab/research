{"title": "The Best of Both Worlds: Combining Model-based and Nonparametric Approaches for 3D Human Body Estimation", "abstract": "Nonparametric based methods have recently shown promising results in\nreconstructing human bodies from monocular images while model-based methods can\nhelp correct these estimates and improve prediction. However, estimating model\nparameters from global image features may lead to noticeable misalignment\nbetween the estimated meshes and image evidence. To address this issue and\nleverage the best of both worlds, we propose a framework of three consecutive\nmodules. A dense map prediction module explicitly establishes the dense UV\ncorrespondence between the image evidence and each part of the body model. The\ninverse kinematics module refines the key point prediction and generates a\nposed template mesh. Finally, a UV inpainting module relies on the\ncorresponding feature, prediction and the posed template, and completes the\npredictions of occluded body shape. Our framework leverages the best of\nnon-parametric and model-based methods and is also robust to partial occlusion.\nExperiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing 3D human\nestimation methods on multiple public benchmarks.", "authors": ["Zhe Wang", "Jimei Yang", "Charless Fowlkes"], "published_date": "2022_05_01", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00508v1", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><tbody><tr><th></th><td colspan=\"2\">H36M</td></tr><tr><th>Method</th><td>MPJPE</td><td>MPJPE-PA</td></tr><tr><th>HMR [12]</th><td>88.0</td><td>56.8</td></tr><tr><th>DaNet [48]</th><td>61.5</td><td>48.6</td></tr><tr><th>HoloPose [6]</th><td>60.3</td><td>46.5</td></tr><tr><th>SPIN [15]</th><td>62.5</td><td>41.1</td></tr><tr><th>I2L [30]</th><td>55.7</td><td>41.1</td></tr><tr><th>DetNet [54]</th><td>64.8</td><td>50.3</td></tr><tr><th>PHMR [17]</th><td>-</td><td>41.2</td></tr><tr><th>DecoMR [46]</th><td>60.5</td><td>39.3</td></tr><tr><th>PyMaf [49]</th><td>57.7</td><td>40.5</td></tr><tr><th>Ours DMP-14</th><td>69.7</td><td>51.7</td></tr><tr><th>Ours IK-14</th><td>67.3</td><td>50.6</td></tr><tr><th>Ours UVI-14</th><td>54.7</td><td>38.4</td></tr></tbody></table>", "caption": "Table 2: Reconstruction errors on Human3.6M dataset.", "list_citation_info": ["[46] Wang Zeng, Wanli Ouyang, Ping Luo, Wentao Liu, and Xiaogang Wang. 3d human mesh regression with dense correspondence.
