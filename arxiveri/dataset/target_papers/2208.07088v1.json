{"title": "Enhancing Deep Learning-based 3-lead ECG Classification with Heartbeat Counting and Demographic Data Integration", "abstract": "Nowadays, an increasing number of people are being diagnosed with\ncardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of death globally. The gold\nstandard for identifying these heart problems is via electrocardiogram (ECG).\nThe standard 12-lead ECG is widely used in clinical practice and the majority\nof current research. However, using a lower number of leads can make ECG more\npervasive as it can be integrated with portable or wearable devices. This\narticle introduces two novel techniques to improve the performance of the\ncurrent deep learning system for 3-lead ECG classification, making it\ncomparable with models that are trained using standard 12-lead ECG.\nSpecifically, we propose a multi-task learning scheme in the form of the number\nof heartbeats regression and an effective mechanism to integrate patient\ndemographic data into the system. With these two advancements, we got\nclassification performance in terms of F1 scores of 0.9796 and 0.8140 on two\nlarge-scale ECG datasets, i.e., Chapman and CPSC-2018, respectively, which\nsurpassed current state-of-the-art ECG classification methods, even those\ntrained on 12-lead data.
