{"title": "Long-HOT: A Modular Hierarchical Approach for Long-Horizon Object Transport", "abstract": "We address key challenges in long-horizon embodied exploration and navigation\nby proposing a new object transport task and a novel modular framework for\ntemporally extended navigation. Our first contribution is the design of a novel\nLong-HOT environment focused on deep exploration and long-horizon planning\nwhere the agent is required to efficiently find and pick up target objects to\nbe carried and dropped at a goal location, with load constraints and optional\naccess to a container if it finds one. Further, we propose a modular\nhierarchical transport policy (HTP) that builds a topological graph of the\nscene to perform exploration with the help of weighted frontiers. Our\nhierarchical approach uses a combination of motion planning algorithms to reach\npoint goals within explored locations and object navigation policies for moving\ntowards semantic targets at unknown locations. Experiments on both our proposed\nHabitat transport task and on MultiOn benchmarks show that our method\nsignificantly outperforms baselines and prior works. Further, we validate the\neffectiveness of our modular approach for long-horizon transport by\ndemonstrating meaningful generalization to much harder transport scenes with\ntraining only on simpler versions of the task.", "authors": ["Sriram Narayanan", "Dinesh Jayaraman", "Manmohan Chandraker"], "published_date": "2022_10_28", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15908v1", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><thead><tr><th>Model</th><th>%Success\\uparrow</th><th>%Progress\\uparrow</th><th>SPL\\uparrow</th><th>PPL\\uparrow</th><th>Episode energy\\downarrow</th><th>%Picked\\uparrow</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OracleMap (Occ)</td><td>56</td><td>68</td><td>34</td><td>37</td><td>0.34</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>OracleMap (Occ+Obj)</td><td>92</td><td>95</td><td>74</td><td>75</td><td>0.05</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td>OracleMap-Waypoints</td><td>85</td><td>90</td><td>51</td><td>52</td><td>0.10</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>NoMap</td><td>43</td><td>63</td><td>26</td><td>32</td><td>0.41</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>ProjNeuralMap[36]</td><td>43</td><td>60</td><td>24</td><td>29</td><td>0.42</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>HTP - NearestFrontier</td><td>52</td><td>66</td><td>24</td><td>29</td><td>0.38</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>HTP - CNN</td><td>56</td><td>72</td><td>25</td><td>31</td><td>0.32</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>HTP - GCN</td><td>59</td><td>70</td><td>28</td><td>33</td><td>0.33</td><td>77</td></tr></tbody></table>", "caption": "Table 2: Standard Long-HOT Task: Comparison of metrics for the proposed HTP along with the baselines in standard transport settings.
