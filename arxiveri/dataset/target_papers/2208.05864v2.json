{"title": "Face Morphing Attacks and Face Image Quality: The Effect of Morphing and the Unsupervised Attack Detection by Quality", "abstract": "Morphing attacks are a form of presentation attacks that gathered increasing\nattention in recent years. A morphed image can be successfully verified to\nmultiple identities. This operation, therefore, poses serious security issues\nrelated to the ability of a travel or identity document to be verified to\nbelong to multiple persons. Previous works touched on the issue of the quality\nof morphing attack images, however, with the main goal of quantitatively\nproofing the realistic appearance of the produced morphing attacks. We theorize\nthat the morphing processes might have an effect on both, the perceptual image\nquality and the image utility in face recognition (FR) when compared to bona\nfide samples. Towards investigating this theory, this work provides an\nextensive analysis of the effect of morphing on face image quality, including\nboth general image quality measures and face image utility measures. This\nanalysis is not limited to a single morphing technique, but rather looks at six\ndifferent morphing techniques and five different data sources using ten\ndifferent quality measures. This analysis reveals consistent separability\nbetween the quality scores of morphing attack and bona fide samples measured by\ncertain quality measures. Our study goes further to build on this effect and\ninvestigate the possibility of performing unsupervised morphing attack\ndetection (MAD) based on quality scores. Our study looks intointra and\ninter-dataset detectability to evaluate the generalizability of such a\ndetection concept on different morphing techniques and bona fide sources. Our\nfinal results point out that a set of quality measures, such as MagFace and\nCNNNIQA, can be used to perform unsupervised and generalized MAD with a correct\nclassification accuracy of over 70%.", "authors": ["Biying Fu", "Naser Damer"], "published_date": "2022_08_11", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.05864v2", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><thead><tr><th colspan=\"5\">FIQA</th><th colspan=\"5\">IQA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>MagFace [56]</td><td>SDD-FIQA [63]</td><td>SER-FIQ [79]</td><td>FaceQnet v2 [40]</td><td>rankIQ [8]</td><td>BRISQUE [75]</td><td>DBCNN [87]</td><td>CNNIQA [43]</td><td>UNIQUE [88]</td><td>dipIQ [51]</td></tr><tr><td>Increase</td><td>Increase</td><td>Increase</td><td>Increase</td><td>Increase</td><td>Decrease</td><td>Increase</td><td>Decrease</td><td>Increase</td><td>Increase</td></tr></tbody></table>", "caption": "TABLE I: The table shows the ordering of the quality measures considered in the manuscript.
