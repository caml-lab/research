{"title": "Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks Against Video Anomaly Detection Systems", "abstract": "Anomaly detection in videos is an important computer vision problem with\nvarious applications including automated video surveillance. Although\nadversarial attacks on image understanding models have been heavily\ninvestigated, there is not much work on adversarial machine learning targeting\nvideo understanding models and no previous work which focuses on video anomaly\ndetection. To this end, we investigate an adversarial machine learning attack\nagainst video anomaly detection systems, that can be implemented via an\neasy-to-perform cyber-attack. Since surveillance cameras are usually connected\nto the server running the anomaly detection model through a wireless network,\nthey are prone to cyber-attacks targeting the wireless connection. We\ndemonstrate how Wi-Fi deauthentication attack, a notoriously easy-to-perform\nand effective denial-of-service (DoS) attack, can be utilized to generate\nadversarial data for video anomaly detection systems. Specifically, we apply\nseveral effects caused by the Wi-Fi deauthentication attack on video quality\n(e.g., slow down, freeze, fast forward, low resolution) to the popular\nbenchmark datasets for video anomaly detection. Our experiments with several\nstate-of-the-art anomaly detection models show that the attackers can\nsignificantly undermine the reliability of video anomaly detection systems by\ncausing frequent false alarms and hiding physical anomalies from the\nsurveillance system.", "authors": ["Furkan Mumcu", "Keval Doshi", "Yasin Yilmaz"], "published_date": "2022_04_07", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03141v1", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Avenue \\to SFF</th><th>ShanghaiTech \\to SFF</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>FFPN [18]</th><td>0.85 \\to 0.684</td><td>0.728 \\to 0.55</td></tr><tr><th>MNAD [23]</th><td>0.885 \\to 0.74</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><th>MOVAD [7]</th><td>0.887 \\to 0.77</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table>", "caption": "Table 1: Performance (AUC) drop in FFPN [18], MNAD [23], and MOVAD [7] due to the Slow-Fast-Freeze effect.
