{"title": "Simulation-to-Reality domain adaptation for offline 3D object annotation on pointclouds with correlation alignment", "abstract": "Annotating objects with 3D bounding boxes in LiDAR pointclouds is a costly\nhuman driven process in an autonomous driving perception system. In this paper,\nwe present a method to semi-automatically annotate real-world pointclouds\ncollected by deployment vehicles using simulated data. We train a 3D object\ndetector model on labeled simulated data from CARLA jointly with real world\npointclouds from our target vehicle. The supervised object detection loss is\naugmented with a CORAL loss term to reduce the distance between labeled\nsimulated and unlabeled real pointcloud feature representations. The goal here\nis to learn representations that are invariant to simulated (labeled) and\nreal-world (unlabeled) target domains. We also provide an updated survey on\ndomain adaptation methods for pointclouds.", "authors": ["Weishuang Zhang", "B Ravi Kiran", "Thomas Gauthier", "Yanis Mazouz", "Theo Steger"], "published_date": "2022_02_06", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02666v2", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><thead><tr><th><p>DA Methods</p></th><th><p>Description</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Aligning I/O representations</p></td><td><p>Dataset-to-Dataset(D2D) transfer [Triess et al., 2021] involves transfer learning between LiDAR Datasets collected with different LiDAR configurations (number, scanning patter, spatial resolution, different classes/label spaces) would require alignment either by upsampling, downsampling, re-sampling of pointclouds.
