{"title": "Semi-Supervised Learning for Mars Imagery Classification and Segmentation", "abstract": "With the progress of Mars exploration, numerous Mars image data are collected\nand need to be analyzed. However, due to the imbalance and distortion of\nMartian data, the performance of existing computer vision models is\nunsatisfactory. In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised framework for\nmachine vision on Mars and try to resolve two specific tasks: classification\nand segmentation. Contrastive learning is a powerful representation learning\ntechnique. However, there is too much information overlap between Martian data\nsamples, leading to a contradiction between contrastive learning and Martian\ndata. Our key idea is to reconcile this contradiction with the help of\nannotations and further take advantage of unlabeled data to improve\nperformance. For classification, we propose to ignore inner-class pairs on\nlabeled data as well as neglect negative pairs on unlabeled data, forming\nsupervised inter-class contrastive learning and unsupervised similarity\nlearning. For segmentation, we extend supervised inter-class contrastive\nlearning into an element-wise mode and use online pseudo labels for supervision\non unlabeled areas. Experimental results show that our learning strategies can\nimprove the classification and segmentation models by a large margin and\noutperform state-of-the-art approaches.", "authors": ["Wenjing Wang", "Lilang Lin", "Zejia Fan", "Jiaying Liu"], "published_date": "2022_06_05", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02180v2", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><tbody><tr><td>Category</td><td>Method</td><td>Top-1 (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Baseline</td><td>AlexNet (Krizhevskyet al., 2012) in (Wagstaff et al., 2018)</td><td>66.70</td></tr><tr><td>ResNet-50 (Heet al., 2016)</td><td>79.28 \\pm 1.76</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Triplet loss (Schroffet al., 2015)</td><td>84.87 \\pm 1.13</td></tr><tr><td>Loss design</td><td>Center loss (Wenet al., 2016)</td><td>82.91 \\pm 0.93</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Focal loss (Lin et al., 2017)</td><td>82.86 \\pm 0.74</td></tr><tr><td>Semi-</td><td>Pseudo labeling (Lee et al., 2013)</td><td>78.64 \\pm 0.04</td></tr><tr><td>supervised</td><td>S4L (Beyeret al., 2019), rotation</td><td>75.19 \\pm 1.73</td></tr><tr><td>learning</td><td>S4L (Beyeret al., 2019), jigsaw</td><td>81.81 \\pm 2.33</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Re-sampling</td><td>Decoupling (Kang et al., 2020), cRT</td><td>80.94 \\pm 1.43</td></tr><tr><td>Decoupling (Kang et al., 2020), LWS</td><td>81.30 \\pm 0.62</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">Re-weighting</td><td>Class-balanced loss (Cuiet al., 2019)</td><td>80.02 \\pm 0.89</td></tr><tr><td>LDAM-DRW (Caoet al., 2019)</td><td>82.12 \\pm 1.92</td></tr><tr><td>Ours</td><td></td><td>95.86 \\pm 1.63</td></tr></tbody></table>", "caption": "Table 1.
