{"title": "Computer Vision for Road Imaging and Pothole Detection: A State-of-the-Art Review of Systems and Algorithms", "abstract": "Computer vision algorithms have been prevalently utilized for 3-D road\nimaging and pothole detection for over two decades. Nonetheless, there is a\nlack of systematic survey articles on state-of-the-art (SoTA) computer vision\ntechniques, especially deep learning models, developed to tackle these\nproblems. This article first introduces the sensing systems employed for 2-D\nand 3-D road data acquisition, including camera(s), laser scanners, and\nMicrosoft Kinect. Afterward, it thoroughly and comprehensively reviews the SoTA\ncomputer vision algorithms, including (1) classical 2-D image processing, (2)\n3-D point cloud modeling and segmentation, and (3) machine/deep learning,\ndeveloped for road pothole detection. This article also discusses the existing\nchallenges and future development trends of computer vision-based road pothole\ndetection approaches: classical 2-D image processing-based and 3-D point cloud\nmodeling and segmentation-based approaches have already become history; and\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated compelling road pothole\ndetection results and are promising to break the bottleneck with the future\nadvances in self/un-supervised learning for multi-modal semantic segmentation.\nWe believe that this survey can serve as practical guidance for developing the\nnext-generation road condition assessment systems.", "authors": ["Nachuan Ma", "Jiahe Fan", "Wenshuo Wang", "Jin Wu", "Yu Jiang", "Lihua Xie", "Rui Fan"], "published_date": "2022_04_28", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13590v1", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><tr><td><p>Reference</p></td><td><p>Input</p></td><td><p>Details</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Koch and Brilakis [14] (2011)</p></td><td><p>Color image</p></td><td><p>A road image is segmented into damaged and undamaged road regions using a histogram-based thresholding method.
