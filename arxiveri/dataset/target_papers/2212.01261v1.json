{"title": "Generative Reasoning Integrated Label Noise Robust Deep Image Representation Learning in Remote Sensing", "abstract": "The development of deep learning based image representation learning (IRL)\nmethods has attracted great attention in the context of remote sensing (RS)\nimage understanding. Most of these methods require the availability of a high\nquantity and quality of annotated training images, which can be time-consuming\nand costly to gather. To reduce labeling costs, publicly available thematic\nmaps, automatic labeling procedures or crowdsourced data can be used. However,\nsuch approaches increase the risk of including label noise in training data. It\nmay result in overfitting on noisy labels when discriminative reasoning is\nemployed as in most of the existing methods. This leads to sub-optimal learning\nprocedures, and thus inaccurate characterization of RS images. In this paper,\nas a first time in RS, we introduce a generative reasoning integrated label\nnoise robust representation learning (GRID) approach. GRID aims to model the\ncomplementary characteristics of discriminative and generative reasoning for\nIRL under noisy labels. To this end, we first integrate generative reasoning\ninto discriminative reasoning through a variational autoencoder. This allows\nour approach to automatically detect training samples with noisy labels. Then,\nthrough our label noise robust hybrid representation learning strategy, GRID\nadjusts the whole learning procedure for IRL of these samples through\ngenerative reasoning and that of the other samples through discriminative\nreasoning. Our approach learns discriminative image representations while\npreventing interference of noisy labels during training independently from the\nIRL method. Thus, unlike the existing methods, GRID does not depend on the type\nof annotation, label noise, neural network, loss or learning task, and thus can\nbe utilized for various RS image understanding problems. Experimental results\nshow the effectiveness of GRID compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "authors": ["Gencer Sumbul", "Beg\u00fcm Demir"], "published_date": "2022_12_02", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01261v1", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<img/>", "caption": "TABLE V: Results (%) Obtained by BCE, ELR [20], FL [19], ASL [22], JoCoR [21] and the Proposed GRID (BCE) Approach Under Different Values of SLNIR (%) (DLRSD archive)", "list_citation_info": ["[20] S.
