{"title": "Perceptual Quality Assessment for Digital Human Heads", "abstract": "Digital humans are attracting more and more research interest during the last\ndecade, the generation, representation, rendering, and animation of which have\nbeen put into large amounts of effort. However, the quality assessment of\ndigital humans has fallen behind. Therefore, to tackle the challenge of digital\nhuman quality assessment issues, we propose the first large-scale quality\nassessment database for three-dimensional (3D) scanned digital human heads\n(DHHs). The constructed database consists of 55 reference DHHs and 1,540\ndistorted DHHs along with the subjective perceptual ratings. Then, a simple yet\neffective full-reference (FR) projection-based method is proposed to evaluate\nthe visual quality of DHHs. The pretrained Swin Transformer tiny is employed\nfor hierarchical feature extraction and the multi-head attention module is\nutilized for feature fusion. The experimental results reveal that the proposed\nmethod exhibits state-of-the-art performance among the mainstream FR metrics.\nThe database is released at https://github.com/zzc-1998/DHHQA.", "authors": ["Zicheng Zhang", "Yingjie Zhou", "Wei Sun", "Xiongkuo Min", "Yuzhe Wu", "Guangtao Zhai"], "published_date": "2022_09_20", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09489v5", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><thead><tr><th>Database</th><th>Source</th><th>Subject-rated Models</th><th>Content</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SJTU-PCQA [3]</td><td>10</td><td>420</td><td>Colored Point Cloud</td><td>Humans, Statues</td></tr><tr><td>WPC [4]</td><td>20</td><td>740</td><td>Colored Point Cloud</td><td>Fruit, Vegetables, Tools</td></tr><tr><td>LSPCQA [5]</td><td>104</td><td>1,240</td><td>Colored Point Cloud</td><td>Animals, Humans, Vehicles, Daily objects</td></tr><tr><td>CMDM [6]</td><td>5</td><td>80</td><td>Colored Mesh</td><td>Humans, Animals, Statues</td></tr><tr><td>TMQA [7]</td><td>55</td><td>3,000</td><td>Textured Mesh</td><td>Statues, Animals, Daily objects</td></tr><tr><td>DHHQA(Ours)</td><td>55</td><td>1,540</td><td>Textured Mesh</td><td>Scanned Real Human Heads</td></tr></tbody></table>", "caption": "Table 1: The comparison of 3D-QA databases and our database.", "list_citation_info": ["[7] Yana Nehm\u00e9, Florent Dupont, Jean-Philippe Farrugia, Patrick Le Callet, and Guillaume Lavou\u00e9, \u201cTextured mesh quality assessment: Large-scale dataset and deep learning-based quality metric,\u201d arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.02397, 2022.", "[3] Qi Yang, Hao Chen, Zhan Ma, Yiling Xu, Rongjun Tang, and Jun Sun, \u201cPredicting the perceptual quality of point cloud: A 3d-to-2d projection-based exploration,\u201d IEEE TMM, pp. 1\u20131, 2020.", "[6] Y.
