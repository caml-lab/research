{"title": "PatchMVSNet: Patch-wise Unsupervised Multi-View Stereo for Weakly-Textured Surface Reconstruction", "abstract": "Learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) has gained fine reconstructions on\npopular datasets. However, supervised learning methods require ground truth for\ntraining, which is hard to be collected, especially for the large-scale\ndatasets. Though nowadays unsupervised learning methods have been proposed and\nhave gotten gratifying results, those methods still fail to reconstruct intact\nresults in challenging scenes, such as weakly-textured surfaces, as those\nmethods primarily depend on pixel-wise photometric consistency which is\nsubjected to various illuminations. To alleviate matching ambiguity in those\nchallenging scenes, this paper proposes robust loss functions leveraging\nconstraints beneath multi-view images: 1) Patch-wise photometric consistency\nloss, which expands the receptive field of the features in multi-view\nsimilarity measuring, 2) Robust twoview geometric consistency, which includes a\ncross-view depth consistency checking with the minimum occlusion. Our\nunsupervised strategy can be implemented with arbitrary depth estimation\nframeworks and can be trained with arbitrary large-scale MVS datasets.\nExperiments show that our method can decrease the matching ambiguity and\nparticularly improve the completeness of weakly-textured reconstruction.\nMoreover, our method reaches the performance of the state-of-the-art methods on\npopular benchmarks, like DTU, Tanks and Temples and ETH3D. The code will be\nreleased soon.", "authors": ["Haonan Dong", "Jian Yao"], "published_date": "2022_03_04", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02156v1", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><tr><td></td><td><p>Methods</p></td><td><p>Acc.</p></td><td><p>Comp.</p></td><td><p>Overall</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\"><p>Traditional</p></td><td><p>Furu[11]</p></td><td><p>0.613</p></td><td><p>0.941</p></td><td><p>0.777</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tola[36]</p></td><td><p>0.342</p></td><td><p>1.190</p></td><td><p>0.766</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Camp[4]</p></td><td><p>0.835</p></td><td><p>0.554</p></td><td><p>0.694</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gipuma[12]</p></td><td>0.283</td><td><p>0.873</p></td><td><p>0.578</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"6\"><p>Supervised</p></td><td><p>SurfaceNet[19]</p></td><td><p>0.450</p></td><td><p>1.040</p></td><td><p>0.745</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MVSNet[47]</p></td><td><p>0.396</p></td><td><p>0.527</p></td><td><p>0.462</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>CIDER[42]</p></td><td><p>0.417</p></td><td><p>0.437</p></td><td><p>0.427</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>CascadeMVSNet[14]</p></td><td><p>0.325</p></td><td><p>0.385</p></td><td>0.355</td></tr><tr><td><p>PatchMatchNet[37]</p></td><td><p>0.427</p></td><td>0.277</td><td>0.352</td></tr><tr><td><p>CVP-MVSNet[46]</p></td><td>0.296</td><td><p>0.406</p></td><td>0.352</td></tr><tr><td><p>Unsupervised</p></td><td><p>PatchMVSNet-MS (Ours)</p></td><td><p>0.538</p></td><td>0.365</td><td><p>0.451</p></td></tr></table><br/>", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative comparisons with traditional and supervised methods on DTU evaluation datasets.
