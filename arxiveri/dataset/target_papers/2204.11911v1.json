{"title": "DArch: Dental Arch Prior-assisted 3D Tooth Instance Segmentation", "abstract": "Automatic tooth instance segmentation on 3D dental models is a fundamental\ntask for computer-aided orthodontic treatments. Existing learning-based methods\nrely heavily on expensive point-wise annotations. To alleviate this problem, we\nare the first to explore a low-cost annotation way for 3D tooth instance\nsegmentation, i.e., labeling all tooth centroids and only a few teeth for each\ndental model. Regarding the challenge when only weak annotation is provided, we\npresent a dental arch prior-assisted 3D tooth segmentation method, namely\nDArch. Our DArch consists of two stages, including tooth centroid detection and\ntooth instance segmentation. Accurately detecting the tooth centroids can help\nlocate the individual tooth, thus benefiting the segmentation. Thus, our DArch\nproposes to leverage the dental arch prior to assist the detection.\nSpecifically, we firstly propose a coarse-to-fine method to estimate the dental\narch, in which the dental arch is initially generated by Bezier curve\nregression, and then a graph-based convolutional network (GCN) is trained to\nrefine it. With the estimated dental arch, we then propose a novel Arch-aware\nPoint Sampling (APS) method to assist the tooth centroid proposal generation.\nMeantime, a segmentor is independently trained using a patch-based training\nstrategy, aiming to segment a tooth instance from a 3D patch centered at the\ntooth centroid. Experimental results on $4,773$ dental models have shown our\nDArch can accurately segment each tooth of a dental model, and its performance\nis superior to the state-of-the-art methods.", "authors": ["Liangdong Qiu", "Chongjie Ye", "Pei Chen", "Yunbi Liu", "Xiaoguang Han", "Shuguang Cui"], "published_date": "2022_04_25", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.11911v1", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><tbody><tr><td>Method</td><td colspan=\"3\">Tooth centroid detection</td><td colspan=\"4\">Tooth instance segmentation</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Acc.</td><td>Recall</td><td>C.
