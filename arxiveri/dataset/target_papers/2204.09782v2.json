{"title": "MultiPathGAN: Structure Preserving Stain Normalization using Unsupervised Multi-domain Adversarial Network with Perception Loss", "abstract": "Histopathology relies on the analysis of microscopic tissue images to\ndiagnose disease. A crucial part of tissue preparation is staining whereby a\ndye is used to make the salient tissue components more distinguishable.\nHowever, differences in laboratory protocols and scanning devices result in\nsignificant confounding appearance variation in the corresponding images. This\nvariation increases both human error and the inter-rater variability, as well\nas hinders the performance of automatic or semi-automatic methods. In the\npresent paper we introduce an unsupervised adversarial network to translate\n(and hence normalize) whole slide images across multiple data acquisition\ndomains. Our key contributions are: (i) an adversarial architecture which\nlearns across multiple domains with a single generator-discriminator network\nusing an information flow branch which optimizes for perceptual loss, and (ii)\nthe inclusion of an additional feature extraction network during training which\nguides the transformation network to keep all the structural features in the\ntissue image intact. We: (i) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod firstly on H\\&E slides of 120 cases of kidney cancer, as well as (ii)\nshow the benefits of the approach on more general problems, such as flexible\nillumination based natural image enhancement and light source adaptation.", "authors": ["Haseeb Nazki", "Ognjen Arandjelovi\u0107", "InHwa Um", "David Harrison"], "published_date": "2022_04_20", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.09782v2", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><tbody><tr><th>Method</th><td>PSNR</td><td>SSIM</td><td>MS-SSIM</td><td>HaarPSI</td></tr><tr><th>Runz et al.
