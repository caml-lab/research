{"title": "Consistency Learning via Decoding Path Augmentation for Transformers in Human Object Interaction Detection", "abstract": "Human-Object Interaction detection is a holistic visual recognition task that\nentails object detection as well as interaction classification. Previous works\nof HOI detection has been addressed by the various compositions of subset\npredictions, e.g., Image -> HO -> I, Image -> HI -> O. Recently, transformer\nbased architecture for HOI has emerged, which directly predicts the HOI\ntriplets in an end-to-end fashion (Image -> HOI). Motivated by various\ninference paths for HOI detection, we propose cross-path consistency learning\n(CPC), which is a novel end-to-end learning strategy to improve HOI detection\nfor transformers by leveraging augmented decoding paths. CPC learning enforces\nall the possible predictions from permuted inference sequences to be\nconsistent. This simple scheme makes the model learn consistent\nrepresentations, thereby improving generalization without increasing model\ncapacity. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and we\nachieved significant improvement on V-COCO and HICO-DET compared to the\nbaseline models. Our code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/CPChoi.", "authors": ["Jihwan Park", "SeungJun Lee", "Hwan Heo", "Hyeong Kyu Choi", "Hyunwoo J.
