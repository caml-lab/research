{"title": "Spacing Loss for Discovering Novel Categories", "abstract": "Novel Class Discovery (NCD) is a learning paradigm, where a machine learning\nmodel is tasked to semantically group instances from unlabeled data, by\nutilizing labeled instances from a disjoint set of classes. In this work, we\nfirst characterize existing NCD approaches into single-stage and two-stage\nmethods based on whether they require access to labeled and unlabeled data\ntogether while discovering new classes. Next, we devise a simple yet powerful\nloss function that enforces separability in the latent space using cues from\nmulti-dimensional scaling, which we refer to as Spacing Loss. Our proposed\nformulation can either operate as a standalone method or can be plugged into\nexisting methods to enhance them. We validate the efficacy of Spacing Loss with\nthorough experimental evaluation across multiple settings on CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100 datasets.", "authors": ["K J Joseph", "Sujoy Paul", "Gaurav Aggarwal", "Soma Biswas", "Piyush Rai", "Kai Han", "Vineeth N Balasubramanian"], "published_date": "2022_04_22", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10595v1", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><thead><tr><th>Datasets \\rightarrow</th><th colspan=\"2\">CIFAR-10</th><th colspan=\"2\">CIFAR-100</th></tr><tr><th>Method</th><th>CA</th><th>NMI</th><th>CA</th><th>NMI</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>K-means [29]</th><td>65.5</td><td>0.422</td><td>66.2</td><td>0.555</td></tr><tr><th>KCL[15]</th><td>66.5</td><td>0.438</td><td>27.4</td><td>0.151</td></tr><tr><th>MCL[16]</th><td>64.2</td><td>0.398</td><td>32.7</td><td>0.202</td></tr><tr><th>DTC[13]</th><td>87.5</td><td>0.735</td><td>72.8</td><td>0.634</td></tr><tr><th>RS*[11]</th><td>84.6</td><td>0.658</td><td>69.5</td><td>0.581</td></tr><tr><th>NCL*[45]</th><td>60.5</td><td>0.479</td><td>59.5</td><td>0.428</td></tr><tr><th>Spacing Loss</th><td>90.5</td><td>0.787</td><td>80.62</td><td>0.719</td></tr></tbody></table>", "caption": "Table 1: Regularization induced by Spacing Loss has better class discovery ability compared to baseline two-stage methods.", "list_citation_info": ["[29] James MacQueen et al.
