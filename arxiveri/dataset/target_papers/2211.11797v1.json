{"title": "Multi-Spectral Image Classification with Ultra-Lean Complex-Valued Models", "abstract": "Multi-spectral imagery is invaluable for remote sensing due to different\nspectral signatures exhibited by materials that often appear identical in\ngreyscale and RGB imagery. Paired with modern deep learning methods, this\nmodality has great potential utility in a variety of remote sensing\napplications, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster recovery efforts.\nState-of-the-art deep learning methods have greatly benefited from large-scale\nannotations like in ImageNet, but existing MSI image datasets lack annotations\nat a similar scale. As an alternative to transfer learning on such data with\nfew annotations, we apply complex-valued co-domain symmetric models to classify\nreal-valued MSI images. Our experiments on 8-band xView data show that our\nultra-lean model trained on xView from scratch without data augmentations can\noutperform ResNet with data augmentation and modified transfer learning on\nxView. Our work is the first to demonstrate the value of complex-valued deep\nlearning on real-valued MSI data.", "authors": ["Utkarsh Singhal", "Stella X. Yu", "Zackery Steck", "Scott Kangas", "Aaron A.
