{"title": "Novel Class Discovery without Forgetting", "abstract": "Humans possess an innate ability to identify and differentiate instances that\nthey are not familiar with, by leveraging and adapting the knowledge that they\nhave acquired so far. Importantly, they achieve this without deteriorating the\nperformance on their earlier learning. Inspired by this, we identify and\nformulate a new, pragmatic problem setting of NCDwF: Novel Class Discovery\nwithout Forgetting, which tasks a machine learning model to incrementally\ndiscover novel categories of instances from unlabeled data, while maintaining\nits performance on the previously seen categories. We propose 1) a method to\ngenerate pseudo-latent representations which act as a proxy for (no longer\navailable) labeled data, thereby alleviating forgetting, 2) a\nmutual-information based regularizer which enhances unsupervised discovery of\nnovel classes, and 3) a simple Known Class Identifier which aids generalized\ninference when the testing data contains instances form both seen and unseen\ncategories. We introduce experimental protocols based on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100\nand ImageNet-1000 to measure the trade-off between knowledge retention and\nnovel class discovery. Our extensive evaluations reveal that existing models\ncatastrophically forget previously seen categories while identifying novel\ncategories, while our method is able to effectively balance between the\ncompeting objectives. We hope our work will attract further research into this\nnewly identified pragmatic problem setting.", "authors": ["K J Joseph", "Sujoy Paul", "Gaurav Aggarwal", "Soma Biswas", "Piyush Rai", "Kai Han", "Vineeth N Balasubramanian"], "published_date": "2022_07_21", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.10659v1", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><tbody><tr><th>Settings (\\rightarrow)</th><td colspan=\"3\">CIFAR-10-5-5</td><td colspan=\"3\">CIFAR-100-80-20</td><td colspan=\"3\">CIFAR-100-50-50</td><td colspan=\"3\">CIFAR-100-20-80</td><td colspan=\"3\">ImageNet-1000-882-30</td></tr><tr><th>Methods (\\downarrow)</th><td>Lab</td><td>Unlab</td><td>All</td><td>Lab</td><td>Unlab</td><td>All</td><td>Lab</td><td>Unlab</td><td>All</td><td>Lab</td><td>Unlab</td><td>All</td><td>Lab</td><td>Unlab</td><td>All</td></tr><tr><th colspan=\"16\">Task Aware Evaluation</th></tr><tr><th>RS [19]</th><td>20.00</td><td>84.48</td><td>52.24</td><td>44.1</td><td>55.7</td><td>49.9</td><td>18.14</td><td>32.56</td><td>25.35</td><td>13.05</td><td>11.5</td><td>12.28</td><td>3.34</td><td>24.54</td><td>13.94</td></tr><tr><th>NCL [61]</th><td>20.00</td><td>59.96</td><td>39.98</td><td>13.59</td><td>57.9</td><td>35.75</td><td>10.14</td><td>12.18</td><td>11.16</td><td>12.65</td><td>4.73</td><td>8.69</td><td>1.52</td><td>11.45</td><td>6.49</td></tr><tr><th>UNO [16]</th><td>33.16</td><td>93.22</td><td>63.19</td><td>2.01</td><td>72.78</td><td>37.39</td><td>1.76</td><td>53.85</td><td>27.81</td><td>7.95</td><td>48.7</td><td>28.33</td><td>0.75</td><td>63.4</td><td>32.08</td></tr><tr><th>Ours</th><td>92.72</td><td>90.32</td><td>91.52</td><td>65.03</td><td>77.03</td><td>71.03</td><td>73.18</td><td>55.66</td><td>64.42</td><td>84.8</td><td>49.67</td><td>67.24</td><td>27.46</td><td>79.07</td><td>53.27</td></tr><tr><th colspan=\"16\">Generalized Evaluation</th></tr><tr><th>UNO [16]</th><td>0</td><td>71.36</td><td>35.68</td><td>0</td><td>58.15</td><td>29.08</td><td>0</td><td>34.22</td><td>17.11</td><td>0</td><td>41.61</td><td>20.81</td><td>0</td><td>68.34</td><td>34.17</td></tr><tr><th>Ours</th><td>79.68</td><td>73.66</td><td>76.67</td><td>53.23</td><td>60.6</td><td>56.92</td><td>62.76</td><td>36.42</td><td>49.59</td><td>57.85</td><td>42.18</td><td>50.02</td><td>21.32</td><td>70.99</td><td>46.16</td></tr></tbody></table>", "caption": "Table 2: Performance of the model in identifying instances of the labeled categories, along with identifying novel categories (\u2018Lab\u2019 and \u2018Unlab\u2019 columns respectively), after incrementally learning to discover novel categories is recorded below.
