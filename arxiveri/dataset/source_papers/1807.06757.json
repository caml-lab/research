{"title": "On evaluation of embodied navigation agents", "abstract": "Skillful mobile operation in three-dimensional environments is a primary topic of study in Artificial Intelligence. The past two years have seen a surge of creative work on navigation. This creative output has produced a plethora of sometimes incompatible task definitions and evaluation protocols. To coordinate ongoing and future research in this area, we have convened a working group to study empirical methodology in navigation research. The present document summarizes the consensus recommendations of this working group. We discuss different problem statements and the role of generalization, present evaluation measures, and provide standard scenarios that can be used for benchmarking.", "authors": ["Peter Anderson", " Angel Chang", " Devendra Singh Chaplot", " Alexey Dosovitskiy", " Saurabh Gupta", " Vladlen Koltun", " Jana Kosecka", " Jitendra Malik", " Roozbeh Mottaghi", " Manolis Savva", " Amir R.
