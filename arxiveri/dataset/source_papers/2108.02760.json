{"title": "Slamp: Stochastic Latent Appearance and Motion Prediction", "abstract": "Motion is an important cue for video prediction and often utilized by separating video content into static and dynamic components. Most of the previous work utilizing motion is deterministic but there are stochastic methods that can model the inherent uncertainty of the future. Existing stochastic models either do not reason about motion explicitly or make limiting assumptions about the static part. In this paper, we reason about appearance and motion in the video stochastically by predicting the future based on the motion history. Explicit reasoning about motion without history already reaches the performance of current stochastic models. The motion history further improves the results by allowing to predict consistent dynamics several frames into the future. Our model performs comparably to the state-of-the-art models on the generic video prediction datasets, however, significantly outperforms them on two challenging real-world autonomous driving datasets with complex motion and dynamic background.", "authors": ["Adil Kaan Akan", " Erkut Erdem", " Aykut Erdem", " Fatma G\u00fcney"], "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02760", "list_table_and_caption": [{"table": "<table><thead><tr><th>Models</th><th>PSNR</th><th>SSIM</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>SVG [5]</th><td>14.50 \\pm 0.04</td><td>0.7090 \\pm 0.0015</td></tr><tr><th>SRVP [9]</th><td>16.93\\pm 0.07</td><td>0.7799 \\pm 0.0020</td></tr><tr><th>SLAMP-Baseline</th><td>16.83 \\pm 0.06</td><td>0.7537 \\pm 0.0018</td></tr><tr><th>SLAMP</th><td>18.07 \\pm 0.08</td><td>0.7736\\pm 0.0019</td></tr></tbody></table>", "caption": "Table 4: Results on MNIST.
